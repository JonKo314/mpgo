Players may decide during each turn, where their next move should be played.
At the end of each turn the gamemaster/server places the stones for all players, conflicts need to be resolved.

Variant A: Players may not play close to their previous moves
    i:      as long as other players are able to play close to them and do so.
    ii:     Player based "heat" is added around the stone the player played. The heat gradually cools off.
            Above a certain heat threshold the player mustn't play in the area, below the threshold heat is used for conflict resolvement.
            A second threshold could be used to prohibit moves, if the heat is below the threshold.
Variant B: Players may not play far away from their stones.
Variant C: During conflict resolving players gain privileged treatment, when they were treated badly before.
Variant D: Players may play more stones, when they have more territory/prisoners (each prisoner might only be usable once).
Variant E: Per turn each player is assigned an area in which they are allowed to play.
Variant F: Moves are only valid, if they would be valid on their own.
Variant G: A connected group of stones may only be touched by one new hostile stone every turn.

Conflict resolvement:
- Random
- Passes
- Priority by closest own stone
- Priority by distance to previous move(s)
